# About

**GovBook** is a public, non-partisan directory of elected officials. Profiles begin with aggregated public data; officials may later **claim** their page to add socials, a bio, and updates.

## Principles
- **Neutrality** — factual data, clear sources
- **Transparency** — show where data comes from
- **Portability** — static, linkable, and archivable
